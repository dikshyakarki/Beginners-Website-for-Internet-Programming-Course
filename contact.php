	After filling out the form and clicking the "Submit" button, visitors will stay on the same page 
	but see a message confirming the form was processed. Submitting the form sets a hidden parameter 
	called action that prevents the form from being displayed again, so that we won't bother visitors 
	with forms they've already filled out. The PHP script also verifies that all the HTML fields are 
	filled in properly. If even one of the field is left empty, it generates an error message.*/
